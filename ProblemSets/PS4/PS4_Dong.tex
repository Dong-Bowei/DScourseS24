\maketitle

I would like to use the List of natural disasters in the United States data from Wikipedia, and the website is \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_in_the_United_States}. By obtaining this data, I would have a more clear perspective of the location distributions of natural disasters in the United States, and I wish to collect more specific county-level natural attributes data to build up my JMP idea.

In question 5, t type of an object is mydf\$date is character.

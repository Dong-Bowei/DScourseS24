\section*{Q 3}
The data I will be using is called \textbf{Disaster Declarations for States and Counties} from FEMA, the reason I am interested in this data set is that it aligns with my research interest for my project, in which I aim to look at county-level natural disasters and how they would influence individuals' relocation decisions. I have used the tutorial "Data Science for Economists
Lecture 6: Webscraping: (1) Server-side and CSS
Grant R. McDermott"

\section*{Q 4}
For question 4, I am using Disaster Declarations for States and Counties from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the dataset interests me because it is on the county level, which fits my interest in urban economics and environmental economics.
